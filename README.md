A Multimodal Deep Leaning Method for Android Malware Detection
==============================================================
# Descpription
The python scripts provide some functions to detect Android malware using static features <br/>
The several static features are used in the project are used in the classification; manifest features, method API features, method opcode features, shared lib. features, string features <br/>
The main classification algorithm, the MNN(Multimodal neural network) takes the static feature vectors and perform the classification. <br/>
In addition to the MNN, we also provides other algorithms like the plain DNN(Depp neural network), the SVM, the RF. <br/>

* FeatureVectorGeneration dir: this dir contains the scripts for generating the five feature vectors <br/>
* Classification dir: this dir contains the scripts for the classification algorithms <br/>
* TPA dir: this dir contains the scripts for the TPA <br/>
 
# Requirment
* Python 3 
* Keras (for deep learning methods)
* Tensorflow (for SVM/RF)
* Other libraries(Kelper lib for TPA, Numpy, scikit-learn, CUDA, etc.)
